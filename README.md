These are all the larger C programs/scripts I have written for ELEC2850. Not all of them work perfectly, but they are here for others to see and to serve as a easy spot for me to access them if need .
They aren't meant to be comprehensive, and are mostly scattered singular files, not assimilated into one project.
All are written by me in Visual Studio.
